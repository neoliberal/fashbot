# Fashbot

This is a bot created to help out with moderation tasks. At the moment it has two functions:

* When a moderator replies to a comment or submission with the text "!fashbot" that mod will receive a PM containing the usernotes for the author of that comment or submission
* The usernote\_archiver script keeps a copy of all usernotes that have ever been added, such that we can prune old usernotes from our subreddit wiki without losing any data
